- Animated objects and VRayProxy support
- 64-bit systems and multi-core processing support

Let's get started!
 
## Step 1: Install MultiScatter v1.096 for 3ds Max 2020 Win x64
 
To install MultiScatter v1.096 for 3ds Max 2020 Win x64, you need to download the plug-in from the official website: [https://multiscatter.com/](https://multiscatter.com/). You can choose between a trial version or a full version, depending on your needs and budget.
 
After downloading the plug-in, run the installer and follow the instructions on the screen. You will need to specify the path to your 3ds Max 2020 installation folder and select the rendering systems that you want to use with MultiScatter.
 
Once the installation is complete, you can launch 3ds Max 2020 and activate MultiScatter from the Plug-ins menu. You will see a new MultiScatter toolbar on the top of your viewport, as well as a new MultiScatter object in the Create panel.
 
## Step 2: Create a Terrain and a Sky
 
Before we add any objects with MultiScatter, we need to create a basic terrain and a sky for our scene. For this example, we will use a simple plane and a VRaySky.
 
To create a plane, go to the Create panel > Geometry > Standard Primitives > Plane. Drag in the viewport to create a large plane that covers the whole grid. You can adjust the length and width segments to add more detail to your terrain.
 
To create a VRaySky, go to the Create panel > Lights > VRay > VRaySun. Click and drag in the viewport to create a sun light and a VRaySky environment map. You can adjust the position and orientation of the sun light to change the time of day and the direction of the shadows.
 
## Step 3: Add Trees with MultiScatter
 
Now we are ready to add some trees with MultiScatter. To do this, we need to have some tree models that we can use as sources for MultiScatter. You can use any models that you have or download some from online libraries, such as [https://www.vizpark.com/](https://www.vizpark.com/).
 
For this example, we will use three different types of trees: oak, birch and pine. We will import them into our scene as VRayProxy objects, which are optimized for rendering large amounts of geometry.
 
To import a VRayProxy object, go to the Create panel > Geometry > VRay > VRayProxy. Click in the viewport to create an empty proxy object. Then go to the Modify panel and click on the Load Proxy button. Browse to the folder where you have your tree models and select one of them. You will see a preview of the model in the viewport.
 
Repeat this process for the other two types of trees. You can scale, rotate and move them as you like. You can also assign different materials to them if you want.
 
Once you have your tree models ready, you can use MultiScatter to distribute them over your terrain. To do this, go to the Create panel > Geometry > MultiScatter > MultiScatter
